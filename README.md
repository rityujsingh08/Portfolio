# 💼 Personal Portfolio Website (HTML & CSS)

This was my **very first hands-on project** in frontend development — a simple yet meaningful portfolio website built using just **HTML** and **CSS**. While it's not my official portfolio, it holds a special place as it marked the beginning of my Learning journey. 🚀

## 🔍 About the Project

The portfolio is a basic static website that showcases:

- 👤 My personal introduction
- 📄 A section for skills and interests
- 🧑‍💻 Project placeholders
- 📞 Contact section
- 🎨 Custom styling with pure CSS

It was a great opportunity for me to get comfortable with the structure of HTML and the styling capabilities of CSS.

## 📁 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

No JavaScript, no frameworks — just pure frontend basics.

## 🚧 Status

✅ Completed  
🛠 No longer maintained, but serves as a solid foundation and a reminder of where I started!

## 📌 What I Learned

- Structuring semantic HTML pages
- Styling components with CSS
- Building responsive layouts
- Designing a clean, minimal UI

## 🧠 Takeaway

This project helped me understand the core building blocks of the web. It laid the groundwork for all the frontend projects I worked on after this. 🌱
